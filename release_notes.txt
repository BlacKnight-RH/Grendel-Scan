============================================================
Known problems and limitations
============================================================
* Terminating a scan within the first few seconds can cause
  unhandled exceptions. Since there is no report to 
  generate, this isn't a huge problem.
  
* A path of /asdf/./fdsa is not considered the same as 
  /asdf/fdsa. Similarly, .. is not properly handled. This
  just causes extra work; it shouldn't cause a big problem.

* JavaScript URLs are ignored.

* The HTTP library isn't as forgiving as many browsers. For
  example, if the web server uses invalid characters in a 
  response header, the parser will choke. 

* Multiple redirects are not always tested properly.

* Session IDs separated from the URL with a semicolon will
  not be processed properly. 

* Redundant query parameter names (in URLs or POST bodies)
  are not always handled correctly.

* Query parameter order submitted through the proxy server 
  may be changed. This isn't a problem for normal web apps.   

  
  


============================================================
1.1
============================================================

New features or improvements
* Finally created a unified GUI.

* Added command line mode.

* Improved the response comparison algorithm, which will 
  make file-not-found profiles, SQL tautologies, directory
  traversal, and other tests more accurate.
  
* Removed pagination from the transaction list. 

* Added support for AMF.


Bug fixes:
* Fixed a bug that prevented a scan from starting without
  base URIs being defined.

* Made the host name and port a directory in the website 
  mirror.
  
* Fixed some problems with the transaction table refreshing

* Fixed bug where the POST parameters from proxy requests
  weren't tested.

  

============================================================
1.0
============================================================

New features or improvements
* Added support for saving and loading scan configurations.

* Added a proxy-only mode.

* Added the ability to load old scan databases so the 
  transactions could be viewed and exported. The proxy can
  still be active during this type of session.

* Added a search engine recon test module.

* Added the ability to export transactions to a plain text 
  format on disk.

* Known session ID names can be added as a regular 
  expression in the GUI.
  
* Made significant improvements to the logic that compares
  and scores two HTTP responses. This logic is used by the
  automatic response code overrides, SQL tautology module,
  directory traversal module, some Nikto tests, and the 
  logged-out detection module. 

* Improved the automatic file-not-found profiles.

* Improved the accuracy of Nikto tests against index.php.

* Added an option for HTTP method with the HTML form 
  baseline module.
  


Bug fixes:
* Fixed a problem caused by some apps only giving a cookie 
  to the first login request in a TCP connection.

* Fixed a bug that caused a serialized exception for 
  BySetCookieTestJob jobs. 

* Fixed problem with requesting HTTPS over proxy.

* Fixed several problems that could cause exceptions when 
  testing session IDs, particularly when stored in cookies.

* Miscellaneous GUI fixes.

* Miscellaneous report format fixes.

* Fixed a problem where some cookies discovered through 
  the proxy were not being tested. A null pointer exception
  may have been thrown also.  

* Fixed a bug that caused a null pointer exception when the
  manual response-code overrides were used.

* Fixed some parsing problems in the robots.txt module.

* Fixed several bugs in handling encrypted proxy requests.

* Miscellaneous report format fixes.

* Fixed a problem where some cookies discovered through 
  the proxy were not being tested. A null pointer exception
  may have been thrown also.  

* Fixed a problem where some websites weren't recognizing
  URI/hex encoded characters with lower case hex letters 
  (a-f).
  
* Made the transaction processing time accurate. Before, it
  was the amount of time that it took the connection queue
  to process the request, not how long it took the server.
  
* Nikto requests are now properly listed in the transaction
  table.
  
  

============================================================
0.9.9
============================================================

New features or improvements
* Improved the efficiency on a number of test modules.

* Fixed a bug with testing for proxy servers using the 
  CONNECT method.
  
* Fixed bug that prevented POST transactions from being 
  properly loaded into the GUI view. 

* Fixed a bug where moving between a parsed URL encoded view
  and a raw view would unescape double URL encoded 
  characters.

* Fixed a bug with how irrelevant parameters were being 
  handled in a URL query string.
  
* Fixed a bug where POST queries sent through the proxy were
  double URL encoded before being sent to the web server.

* Fixed a bug that caused a SQLException to be thrown during
  some HTTP transaction saves.

  
  
============================================================
0.9.8
============================================================

not be used. Update!

New features or improvements
* Added manual testing features to the scan status window.



============================================================
0.9.7
============================================================
New features or improvements
* New module to test for cross-site tracing (XST).

* New module to test for a web server that also proxies 
  requests.

* New module that parses robots.txt, requests all discovered 
  paths, and reports disallowed paths.

  not fully tested yet. 
 
* Added a GUI option for maximum requests in a scan.

* Added a GUI option for maximum failed requests to a host.

  overrides. Previously, only certain file extensions were
  tested.

* Significantly improved the efficiency of Nikto tests by
  checking for the presence of CGI directories.

* Added a GUI option for the user agent string; included
  strings for IE, Firefox and Opera.

* Added a GUI option for the output directory. This is the
  default location for the report, error.log, the HTTP 
  transaction record, and module output, such as the 
  website mirror.

* Corrected unhandled exception logging in the thread group

* Fixed a problem in the Form Baseline module that caused
  a NullPointerException when no method was explicitly 
  defined in the form tag.
  
* Fixed a bug in the URL encoding. This was causing problems
  for some tests that performed their own URL encoding, 
  primarily SQL injection.
  
* Fixed problem where some test jobs were being deleted 
  without being run. They weren't being removed from the 
  pending count, which prevented the scan from completing.
  
* Fixed several problems with exceptions being thrown when
  a scan is terminated.

* Fixed a bug in the build process that didn't include the
  help files.
  
* Created a work around for a null pointer exception being 
  thrown in a getPath() call. I'm not clear why it's 
  happening, but the work around will return an empty path.

* Fixed a ConcurrentModificationException in 
  ResponseCodeOverrides.  
  
* Fixed a bug where the spider was choking on mailto: links  

* Fixed a problem where some hung jobs would prevent a 
  terminated scan from generating a report.
  
* Fixed a bug with how redirects were being handled if the 
  redirect location wasn't reachable.
  
* Fixed a really bone-headed bug that prevented a lot of 
  relative URIs from being correctly processed.
  
* Added a work around for a bug in Java's URI.resolve 
  function. Occured when the base URI doesn't have a path.
    
* Fixed a bug where POSTs recieved through the proxy weren't
  being forwarded on properly.
  
* Fixed a bugs where POST query parameters weren't being   
  
* Fixed a bug where POST uniqueness was not being properly
  calculated.
  
* Added some limits to kep overly large HTML files from 
  causing overly long loops.
  
* Fixed a bug where the dir traversal module wasn't being 
  run.
  
* Fixed bug where unhandled exceptions in the categorizer
  and requester threads weren't being properly caught, which 
  would crash the thread.  
  
* Fixed a bug where POSTs weren't handled correctly by some
  web servers. This was mostly seen with requests sent 
  through the internal proxy server.

* Fixed a bug with set-cookie being ignored in a redirect.

* Fixed a bug in handling proxy requests for non standard
  HTTPS ports.
  
* Fixed some intermittent SQL problems that were forcing
  queries to be resent.
