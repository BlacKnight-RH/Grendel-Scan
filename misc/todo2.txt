put paros log parsing on the to do list
List the session IDs discovered
setup GUI tooltips
logged out detection as an option in the GUI
clone the request wrapper on line 424 in the redirect handling
copying the headers from a post into the get for it's redirects will copy the Content-Type header, which isn't needed
The login needs to be handled before the redirect is
generate report if there is no redirect after html form login

use consecutive connection failures, instead of total
scripted, or simple regex modifications to a transaction before it is tested
